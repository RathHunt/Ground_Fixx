Ground_Fixx is a (simple) program for fixing out the mess tath leaves behind te Ground virus

such "mess" is described as follows:
-files are renamed by placing a "g" in front so calling them from shortcut or command line shows a non-exist error
-such files are hidden also, so the regular user might think they are just deleted
-even if hidden view is enabled, the files have system file atrribute that leads to at least a warning when trying to rename them

what Ground_Fixx does:
-automatically identify such files and restores them to original state

you can redistribute it as you please
